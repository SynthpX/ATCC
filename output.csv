Kakeru Satsuki,A different spacetime
Yuka Minase,Why have we come to this this Crimson Night

Misuzu Kusakabe,Do you want to help this girl
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Misuzu Kusakabe,Even if you run and hide the result is the same huh All right I understand However I dont know what could be in that tower You may not be able to completely protect her Even then are you sure

Kakeru Satsuki,Yuka
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Misuzu Kusakabe,Have you calmed down a bit

Misuzu Kusakabe,What about Minasekun
Yuka Minase,Somehow
Misuzu Kusakabe,Geez I feel like Im being toyed around with as they please Every single time Even though I didnt want to be chosen
Kakeru Satsuki,Them You said it before right Them Could it be that there are others people that were also brought into the Crimson Night
Misuzu Kusakabe,Yeah there are At the very least there are three others But Ive only seen the face of one of them The other two I caught a glimpse of as they were leaving out of the corner of my eye
Kakeru Satsuki,What kind of people are they
Misuzu Kusakabe,All three of them are students at Rainbow High Two girls and one guy
Kakeru Satsuki,Were they running away from them
Misuzu Kusakabe,No they were fighting with the demons
Yuka Minase,Demons
Misuzu Kusakabe,Yeah In Onmyoudou all wicked beings are called demons
TL Note,TL NOTE Onmyoudou is a practice of spiritual balance based on Wu Xing and Yin and Yang An Onmyouji is a practitioner of this
Kakeru Satsuki,So youre an Onmyouji right
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its hereditary Those people were not shiki
TL Note,TL NOTE Shiki are a type of spirit summoned by an onmyouji often invisible to normal people
Misuzu Kusakabe,Which means rather than demons they are spirits of darkness An Ahriman might be more appropriate
Kakeru Satsuki,Ahriman
Yuka Minase,Um so where are the other students
Misuzu Kusakabe,Yeah Ill let you meet them The one that I saw is a senior I also know her name
Kakeru Satsuki,If they were fighting do they have some kind of power So are they also Onmyouji
Misuzu Kusakabe,No thats not it About their powers itd be better to ask them yourself
Kakeru Satsuki,Do I have some kind of power too
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,At that time that black knight said that I was
Misuzu Kusakabe,Satsukikun can you try taking that off
Kakeru Satsuki,My right eye
Misuzu Kusakabe,Im not really certain but you remember the pain back then right
Kakeru Satsuki,Ahh right Now that you mention it whenever we enter the Crimson Night my right eye always
Misuzu Kusakabe,Let me see
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Yuka Minase,Senpai Is something wrong
Misuzu Kusakabe,Minasekun dont you feel anything
Yuka Minase,Huh
Misuzu Kusakabe,I see thats enough thank you You probably havent awakened yet I dont know what kind of power it has but I will find out as much as I can about that eye
Kakeru Satsuki,I also have some kind of power
Yuka Minase,So that means that I also have something Thats why you were chosen right Same for me Is it all right if we stay like this
Kakeru Satsuki,Yeah
Yuka Minase,Are we going to be killed When I die stay by my side
Kakeru Satsuki,Stupid Dont say stuff like that
Yuka Minase,But
Kakeru Satsuki,Ill protect you Yuka I will for sure

Kakeru Satsuki,Its nothing Come on class is gonna start soon
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,The person who woke up the demon is you A demon was it So then you is It really is me If so then its my fault that Yuka and everyone else have been dragged into the Crimson Night All because of me
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,Huh Ah SSorry Sorry
Tadashi Teruya,Kakerukun Not enough sleep You mustve been doing something staying up late eh Pervert Kaorisan Hitting people with textbooks means failing this grade
Kaori Natsuki,Sensei please throw this noisy piece of trash away quickly
Tadashi Teruya,Youre so mean What do you mean by trash
Misuzu Kusakabe,Powers
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes I want to awaken them Powers that are supposedly dormant inside of me
Misuzu Kusakabe,What do you want me to do
Kakeru Satsuki,Please teach me how to fight
TL Note,If these dormant powers are meant for fighting then they might awaken if I fight No they should awaken
Misuzu Kusakabe,Thatd be nice I understand your feeling to protect Yuka Minase However haste tends to bring about mistakes You cant become an expert overnight
Kakeru Satsuki,I know that Even so I want to do it No Its something I must do Because of me Please Kusakabesenpai Please teach me how to use a sword

Yuka Minase,Thats not it I just felt better after seeing your smile Thats why thank you
Yukiko Hirohara,Ah So thats what you were going on about Well then Ill smile some more for you
Kakeru Satsuki,This isnt good Theres no point in reading this bogus
Yuka Minase,Is he an acquaintance of yours Yukikochan
Yukiko Hirohara,Eh Uh kind of
Yuka Minase,Could it be someone you like
Yukiko Hirohara,Ehh Thats wrong Geez what are you saying Yukasan
Yuka Minase,So thats not it Im sorry
Yukiko Hirohara,That person I dont know how to put this but Hes the same That person is also suffering
Yuka Minase,Yukikochan
Yukiko Hirohara,Yukasan I didnt think so before but you actually have some pretty nice breasts They feel so good
Yuka Minase,HHold on Yukikochan
Yukiko Hirohara,Its so calming
Tadashi Teruya,All right Shiorichan hows this
Shiori Momono,It seems like there is something wrong with your head
Tadashi Teruya,Eh
Shiori Momono,That is a complete set Why is the fifth book beside the first
Tadashi Teruya,Eh Ah youre right
Shiori Momono,The numbers are not just for display you know Please fix it
Kakeru Satsuki,Whats going on
Kaori Natsuki,Shiorichan has become the librarian so Tadashi said hed help out and this is how things ended up
Kakeru Satsuki,So thats how it is
Tadashi Teruya,All right Okay now its perfect
Shiori Momono,On second thought lets move that whole set down one shelf Please do it swiftly
Tadashi Teruya,Fine
Kaori Natsuki,Tadashi good luck
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun Senpai
Shiori Momono,Misuzu Kusakabe huh
Misuzu Kusakabe,The Kusakabe household has always protected the country and people fulfilling its role as an Onmyouji clan Thats why Ive never questioned becoming an Onmyouji Furthermore if I were to become one I wished to be strong Its a red seal
Kakeru Satsuki,A red seal
Misuzu Kusakabe,I hold all five treasured swords of the Kusakabe lineage These demon swords are quite powerful so I usually have them sealed but when the need arises I summon them Kogarasu Maru Amakuni
TL Note,The Kogarasu Maru is a double bladed sword similar to both the Chinese straight sword and Japanese tachi created by Amakuni a legendary blacksmith considered the father of the Japanese katana
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kashagiri Hiromitsu
TL Note,This sword was rumored to have cut a kasha burning wagon a demon used to steal dead bodies in half
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kannagiri Nagamitsu
TL Note,This sword was rumored to have cut a demon in disguise as a carpenter in half along with the kanna carpenters plane it was carrying
Misuzu Kusakabe,Tachibana Dousetsu Raikiri
TL Note,Tachibana Dousetsu is a samurai rumored to have sliced a lightning bolt in half with his sword Raikiri the lightning blade
Misuzu Kusakabe,and finally Doujigiri Yatsuna
TL Note,This sword was rumored to have cut off the head of the demon Shuten Douji
Misuzu Kusakabe,The Kusakabe house being an Onmyouji clan was required to have powerful heirs obtain the treasured swords so it had members of the bloodline fight with real swords and gave one katana to each victor
Kakeru Satsuki,For there to be all five katanas here
Yuka Minase,So you won all of them right Incredible
Misuzu Kusakabe,Originally in order to prevent the concentration of all the power at one point theres an unspoken agreement that one person should only get one sword Since they were all legitimate fights though it cant be helped So because of that I had to leave my hometown
Kakeru Satsuki,Your hometown
Yuka Minase,Then this house is
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its my mothers villa Because my life is being sought after by everyone in the main family I moved away from my family and have lived here alone
Yuka Minase,They are after your life
Kakeru Satsuki,Why is that You got your katanas through legitimate fights right
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kusakabe is a distinguished family As a distinguished family honor is of utmost importance For someone young and also a woman to take all of the treasured swords isnt entertaining to my senpais Besides in my last battle I Ill keep my story at that Now lets begin
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its heavier than you thought right
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,Try it out
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,One more time
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,So thats how it is You and Kakeru Satsuki were both raised in an institution huh
Yuka Minase,Yes Thank goodness
Misuzu Kusakabe,Hm
Yuka Minase,You cant see a black moon at night
Misuzu Kusakabe,Oh
Yuka Minase,How is Kakerukun
Misuzu Kusakabe,He has no talent with the sword Still its better than him doing nothing
Yuka Minase,Will Kakerukuns power awaken
Misuzu Kusakabe,If hes lucky is my answer for now
Yuka Minase,Your last match You started talking about it then stopped halfway What happened You stopped talking because you didnt want to talk about it right Im sorry
Misuzu Kusakabe,I cut down my father In the fight for the last treasured sword Doujigiri Yasutsuna I cut down Toushi Kusakabe my father the head of the Kusakabe household Even though it was an official match the other disciples will probably never forgive me
Yuka Minase,Senpai
Misuzu Kusakabe,I was on bad terms with my father My father didnt like the fact that I looked up to a certain person
Yuka Minase,A certain person
Misuzu Kusakabe,Misao Kusakabe The woman known as the greatest female Onmyouji However she broke a law and was banished
Yuka Minase,What did she do
Misuzu Kusakabe,She became a Gehou user
Yuka Minase,Gehou
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its a method that strays from the Kusakabe ways which has cult spells and even western magic blended in
TL Note,The reallife definition of Gehou 外法 げほう is any religion that strays from Buddhism as opposed to Naihou 内法 ないほう
Misuzu Kusakabe,By the way This is also a form of Gehou
Yuka Minase,Misaosan right now is
Misuzu Kusakabe,She was banished seventy years ago
Yuka Minase,That means shes already
Misuzu Kusakabe,No
Yuka Minase,Eh
Misuzu Kusakabe,Maybe I might be able to meet her Over there
Yuka Minase,Eh By over there do you mean the Crimson Night Kakerukun
Misuzu Kusakabe,Did you do it Youre going to keep trying until you can do it Go back inside
Kakeru Satsuki,Theres no point in doing this Please teach me how to do it with real combat
Misuzu Kusakabe,No Its still too early
Kakeru Satsuki,Teach me even if its too early
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,I dont have time While Im doing this its going to happen again
Misuzu Kusakabe,Go back inside
Kakeru Satsuki,Kusakabesenpai I
Lisette,No please let me out
Kakeru Satsuki,You I did it All right come
Misuzu Kusakabe,Dont be so conceited after defeating just a single underling
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,A black knight
Misuzu Kusakabe,I have no intentions of dying Human forms Are you implying that you were once human And if we are
Yuka Minase,Why do you look like that
Misuzu Kusakabe,Run away

Misuzu Kusakabe,Leave the city
Yukiko Hirohara,Thats right I thought about that During the Crimson Night you cant see past the horizon right If we left the city we wouldnt have to go through the Crimson Night anymore I think
Takahisa Tajima,Thats impossible
Yukiko Hirohara,Takahisasenpai
Misuzu Kusakabe,Impossible
Takahisa Tajima,I already tried that I couldnt leave
Yukiko Hirohara,What do you mean by couldnt leave
Takahisa Tajima,Theres a wall There some kind of strange wall surrounding the city
Saiko Akamine,A wall What do you mean by wall Whatre you talking about

Acedia,I guess it should be Nice to meet you
Misuzu Kusakabe,Why do you call us fragments Why attack us We have no reason to fight with you in this world
Acedia,Even if you dont have a reason we do
Misuzu Kusakabe,What do you mean by that
Acedia,I almost feel sorry for you for not knowing anything
Misuzu Kusakabe,Then how about you tell us Would it be inconvenient for you to do that
Acedia,Occasionally being selfconscious of adversity can strengthen oneself which gives one the bothersome feeling of being responsible for everything
Misuzu Kusakabe,In other words if we know the truth you guys wont be able to win
Acedia,I wont play along with your sly interrogations Let me tell you just one thing Your existences themselves are a sin
Misuzu Kusakabe,You speak as if you are the one that yields justice
Acedia,All of you must disappear For the future

Misuzu Kusakabe,We cant say for sure that shes safe but it seems she at least escaped
Yukiko Hirohara,She couldnt have gone that far in this amount of time Lets split up and search for her
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its dangerous but I guess theres no choice Yukiko Kukuri Well search door to door around the school
Yukiko Hirohara,Understood
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kakeru and Takahisa are extremely exhausted While you wait until you recover fully search within the school

Misuzu Kusakabe,Thats why it hurts to smile I guess youd call it karma
Yukiko Hirohara,Lets stop If you knew what Id done Im sure that even you would change
Takahisa Tajima,Ive been watching you all this time
Yukiko Hirohara,I know
Takahisa Tajima,Tell me about it
Yukiko Hirohara,Its a secret If youre too mindful of me itd just be awkward instead
Takahisa Tajima,How pathetic of me I worried too much These damn bugs Dont be eavesdropping on peoples secret conversations

Yukiko Hirohara,Yes
Yuka Minase,Even though everyone has amazing powers and are risking their lives fighting Im the only one thats
Yukiko Hirohara,You dont have to worry about that Fighting doesnt fit you
Yuka Minase,Its because I didnt have any powers that Kakerukun left me
Yukiko Hirohara,What are you talking about Kakerusenpai and you are passionately in love arent you Hes only fighting because he wants to protect you Youre loved in a lot of different ways Why you little Yukasan Maybe Ill tell you about my past Up until a Japanese person picked me upN I lived in the country of Drasvenia By the time I was old enough to be aware of things the world was already hell itself A civil war to wash away blood with blood Everyone fought to hold what was precious to them amongst the mayhem and destruction Men women and children I have a immortal body If I blow myself up or step on a mine I still regenerate Thats why I was used as a human weapon My family and friends died one after another Thats why I killed and killed and continued to kill Only the phrase For my friends and tomorrow kept supporting me My personality and battle abilities were honed in that hell If they hadnt I wouldnt have been able to protect my friends and my future If I dont seal myself with my glasses I become a really dangerous girl I dont want you to be like me Yukasan Thats why its better not to awaken your powers to fight Im pretty sure Kakerusenpai would like it that way too
Yuka Minase,Yukikochan
Yukiko Hirohara,Yukasan
Yuka Minase,Yukikochan Im all right Im all right now After all I
Avaritia,Its useless This isnt something you can do

Misuzu Kusakabe,Geez I feel like Im being toyed around with as they please Every single time Even though I didnt want to be chosen
Kakeru Satsuki,Them You said it before right Them Could it be that there are others people that were also brought into the Crimson Night
Misuzu Kusakabe,Yeah there are At the very least there are three others But Ive only seen the face of one of them The other two I caught a glimpse of as they were leaving out of the corner of my eye
Kakeru Satsuki,What kind of people are they
Misuzu Kusakabe,All three of them are students at Rainbow High Two girls and one guy
Kakeru Satsuki,Were they running away from them
Misuzu Kusakabe,No they were fighting with the demons
Yuka Minase,Demons
Misuzu Kusakabe,Yeah In Onmyoudou all wicked beings are called demons
TL Note,TL NOTE Onmyoudou is a practice of spiritual balance based on Wu Xing and Yin and Yang An Onmyouji is a practitioner of this
Kakeru Satsuki,So youre an Onmyouji right
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its hereditary Those people were not shiki
TL Note,TL NOTE Shiki are a type of spirit summoned by an onmyouji often invisible to normal people
Misuzu Kusakabe,Which means rather than demons they are spirits of darkness An Ahriman might be more appropriate
Kakeru Satsuki,Ahriman
Yuka Minase,Um so where are the other students
Misuzu Kusakabe,Yeah Ill let you meet them The one that I saw is a senior I also know her name
Kakeru Satsuki,If they were fighting do they have some kind of power So are they also Onmyouji
Misuzu Kusakabe,No thats not it About their powers itd be better to ask them yourself
Kakeru Satsuki,Do I have some kind of power too
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,At that time that black knight said that I was
Misuzu Kusakabe,Satsukikun can you try taking that off
Kakeru Satsuki,My right eye
Misuzu Kusakabe,Im not really certain but you remember the pain back then right
Kakeru Satsuki,Ahh right Now that you mention it whenever we enter the Crimson Night my right eye always
Misuzu Kusakabe,Let me see
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Yuka Minase,Senpai Is something wrong
Misuzu Kusakabe,Minasekun dont you feel anything
Yuka Minase,Huh
Misuzu Kusakabe,I see thats enough thank you You probably havent awakened yet I dont know what kind of power it has but I will find out as much as I can about that eye
Kakeru Satsuki,I also have some kind of power
Yuka Minase,So that means that I also have something Thats why you were chosen right Same for me Is it all right if we stay like this
Kakeru Satsuki,Yeah
Yuka Minase,Are we going to be killed When I die stay by my side
Kakeru Satsuki,Stupid Dont say stuff like that

Kakeru Satsuki,The person who woke up the demon is you A demon was it So then you is It really is me If so then its my fault that Yuka and everyone else have been dragged into the Crimson Night All because of me
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,Huh Ah SSorry Sorry
Tadashi Teruya,Kakerukun Not enough sleep You mustve been doing something staying up late eh Pervert Kaorisan Hitting people with textbooks means failing this grade

Kakeru Satsuki,Please teach me how to fight
TL Note,If these dormant powers are meant for fighting then they might awaken if I fight No they should awaken

Tadashi Teruya,All right Shiorichan hows this
Shiori Momono,It seems like there is something wrong with your head
Tadashi Teruya,Eh
Shiori Momono,That is a complete set Why is the fifth book beside the first
Tadashi Teruya,Eh Ah youre right
Shiori Momono,The numbers are not just for display you know Please fix it
Kakeru Satsuki,Whats going on
Kaori Natsuki,Shiorichan has become the librarian so Tadashi said hed help out and this is how things ended up
Kakeru Satsuki,So thats how it is
Tadashi Teruya,All right Okay now its perfect
Shiori Momono,On second thought lets move that whole set down one shelf Please do it swiftly
Tadashi Teruya,Fine
Kaori Natsuki,Tadashi good luck
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun Senpai
Shiori Momono,Misuzu Kusakabe huh
Misuzu Kusakabe,The Kusakabe household has always protected the country and people fulfilling its role as an Onmyouji clan Thats why Ive never questioned becoming an Onmyouji Furthermore if I were to become one I wished to be strong Its a red seal
Kakeru Satsuki,A red seal
Misuzu Kusakabe,I hold all five treasured swords of the Kusakabe lineage These demon swords are quite powerful so I usually have them sealed but when the need arises I summon them Kogarasu Maru Amakuni
TL Note,The Kogarasu Maru is a double bladed sword similar to both the Chinese straight sword and Japanese tachi created by Amakuni a legendary blacksmith considered the father of the Japanese katana
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kashagiri Hiromitsu
TL Note,This sword was rumored to have cut a kasha burning wagon a demon used to steal dead bodies in half
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kannagiri Nagamitsu
TL Note,This sword was rumored to have cut a demon in disguise as a carpenter in half along with the kanna carpenters plane it was carrying
Misuzu Kusakabe,Tachibana Dousetsu Raikiri
TL Note,Tachibana Dousetsu is a samurai rumored to have sliced a lightning bolt in half with his sword Raikiri the lightning blade
Misuzu Kusakabe,and finally Doujigiri Yatsuna
TL Note,This sword was rumored to have cut off the head of the demon Shuten Douji
Misuzu Kusakabe,The Kusakabe house being an Onmyouji clan was required to have powerful heirs obtain the treasured swords so it had members of the bloodline fight with real swords and gave one katana to each victor
Kakeru Satsuki,For there to be all five katanas here
Yuka Minase,So you won all of them right Incredible
Misuzu Kusakabe,Originally in order to prevent the concentration of all the power at one point theres an unspoken agreement that one person should only get one sword Since they were all legitimate fights though it cant be helped So because of that I had to leave my hometown
Kakeru Satsuki,Your hometown
Yuka Minase,Then this house is
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its my mothers villa Because my life is being sought after by everyone in the main family I moved away from my family and have lived here alone
Yuka Minase,They are after your life
Kakeru Satsuki,Why is that You got your katanas through legitimate fights right
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kusakabe is a distinguished family As a distinguished family honor is of utmost importance For someone young and also a woman to take all of the treasured swords isnt entertaining to my senpais Besides in my last battle I Ill keep my story at that Now lets begin
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its heavier than you thought right
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,Try it out
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,One more time
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes
Misuzu Kusakabe,So thats how it is You and Kakeru Satsuki were both raised in an institution huh
Yuka Minase,Yes Thank goodness
Misuzu Kusakabe,Hm
Yuka Minase,You cant see a black moon at night
Misuzu Kusakabe,Oh
Yuka Minase,How is Kakerukun
Misuzu Kusakabe,He has no talent with the sword Still its better than him doing nothing
Yuka Minase,Will Kakerukuns power awaken
Misuzu Kusakabe,If hes lucky is my answer for now
Yuka Minase,Your last match You started talking about it then stopped halfway What happened You stopped talking because you didnt want to talk about it right Im sorry
Misuzu Kusakabe,I cut down my father In the fight for the last treasured sword Doujigiri Yasutsuna I cut down Toushi Kusakabe my father the head of the Kusakabe household Even though it was an official match the other disciples will probably never forgive me
Yuka Minase,Senpai
Misuzu Kusakabe,I was on bad terms with my father My father didnt like the fact that I looked up to a certain person
Yuka Minase,A certain person
Misuzu Kusakabe,Misao Kusakabe The woman known as the greatest female Onmyouji However she broke a law and was banished
Yuka Minase,What did she do
Misuzu Kusakabe,She became a Gehou user
Yuka Minase,Gehou
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its a method that strays from the Kusakabe ways which has cult spells and even western magic blended in
TL Note,The reallife definition of Gehou 外法 げほう is any religion that strays from Buddhism as opposed to Naihou 内法 ないほう
Misuzu Kusakabe,By the way This is also a form of Gehou
Yuka Minase,Misaosan right now is
Misuzu Kusakabe,She was banished seventy years ago
Yuka Minase,That means shes already
Misuzu Kusakabe,No
Yuka Minase,Eh
Misuzu Kusakabe,Maybe I might be able to meet her Over there
Yuka Minase,Eh By over there do you mean the Crimson Night Kakerukun
Misuzu Kusakabe,Did you do it Youre going to keep trying until you can do it Go back inside
Kakeru Satsuki,Theres no point in doing this Please teach me how to do it with real combat
Misuzu Kusakabe,No Its still too early
Kakeru Satsuki,Teach me even if its too early
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,I dont have time While Im doing this its going to happen again
Misuzu Kusakabe,Go back inside
Kakeru Satsuki,Kusakabesenpai I
Lisette,No please let me out
Kakeru Satsuki,You I did it All right come
Misuzu Kusakabe,Dont be so conceited after defeating just a single underling
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,A black knight
Misuzu Kusakabe,I have no intentions of dying Human forms Are you implying that you were once human And if we are
Yuka Minase,Why do you look like that
Misuzu Kusakabe,Run away
Kakeru Satsuki,Senpai but
Misuzu Kusakabe,Dont fight them blindly If you want to protect Yuka Minase then you must run Go What are you doing Hurry Run and live on Kakeru Yuka
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun Dont look back Run Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,Shh All right hes gone
Yuka Minase,Kakerukun
Kakeru Satsuki,Dammit

Kakeru Satsuki,Ill distract him While I do that run away

Misuzu Kusakabe,For what reason do you fight
Kakeru Satsuki,That is to protect Yuka
Misuzu Kusakabe,What a futile ring it has They just slip through your mouth and arent becoming flesh and blood Your feelings arent turning into power Did you have the resolution in your sword
Kakeru Satsuki,Resolution
Misuzu Kusakabe,Resolution is the acquisition of comprehension Right now you dont fully comprehend the circumstances First to train is not your body but your heart Change feelings into strength Think only about that
Kakeru Satsuki,Yes Change my feelings into strength I want strength Strength to protect Yuka Yuka

Yukiko Hirohara,Kakerusenpai has that eye
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kakerukun called it the Aeons Eye
Yukiko Hirohara,Eh Aeons Eye Really Do you know about it I heard about it when I was younger In the medieval ages the king of the kingdom Drasvenia had Aeons Eye
Misuzu Kusakabe,And the name of that king
Yukiko Hirohara,I dont remember that much
Misuzu Kusakabe,Verard
Yukiko Hirohara,Ah Thats it Im surprised you know Misuzusan
Misuzu Kusakabe,It seems that he appeared in Kakerus dream
Yukiko Hirohara,In his dream
Misuzu Kusakabe,So how did that king die
Yukiko Hirohara,I heard that he got tricked by a witch and his country fell so he took his own life
Misuzu Kusakabe,Witch It cant be
Yukiko Hirohara,So does that have anything to do with Yukasans behaviour
Misuzu Kusakabe,No Thats an entirely different situation
Yukiko Hirohara,Different
Kakeru Satsuki,Yuka Whats wrong What happened
Yuka Minase,Its nothing
Kakeru Satsuki,Theres no way it can be nothing Tell me about it Did I do something
Yuka Minase,You said Misuzusenpai You called Misuzusan Misuzusenpai
Kakeru Satsuki,Whats wrong with that
Yuka Minase,Misuzusan called you Kakeru
Kakeru Satsuki,What are you talking about
Yuka Minase,Its just strange You were calling her Kusakabesenpai And she was calling you Kakerukun Up until yesterday anyways But that changed this morning
Kakeru Satsuki,Hey Yuka Get a grip on yourself What nonsense are you talking about
Yuka Minase,I saw you two
Kakeru Satsuki,Thats not it Yuka Youre mistaken Misuzusenpai and I arent
Yuka Minase,You said it again You called her Misuzusenpai again
Kakeru Satsuki,Yuka cant you believe me
Misuzu Kusakabe,Leave the city
Yukiko Hirohara,Thats right I thought about that During the Crimson Night you cant see past the horizon right If we left the city we wouldnt have to go through the Crimson Night anymore I think
Takahisa Tajima,Thats impossible
Yukiko Hirohara,Takahisasenpai
Misuzu Kusakabe,Impossible
Takahisa Tajima,I already tried that I couldnt leave
Yukiko Hirohara,What do you mean by couldnt leave
Takahisa Tajima,Theres a wall There some kind of strange wall surrounding the city
Saiko Akamine,A wall What do you mean by wall Whatre you talking about

Takahisa Tajima,I think Im gonna have a barbecue with you today
Invidia,I wont kill you that simply You will suffer as much as I have
Acedia,I guess it should be Nice to meet you
Misuzu Kusakabe,Why do you call us fragments Why attack us We have no reason to fight with you in this world
Acedia,Even if you dont have a reason we do
Misuzu Kusakabe,What do you mean by that
Acedia,I almost feel sorry for you for not knowing anything
Misuzu Kusakabe,Then how about you tell us Would it be inconvenient for you to do that
Acedia,Occasionally being selfconscious of adversity can strengthen oneself which gives one the bothersome feeling of being responsible for everything
Misuzu Kusakabe,In other words if we know the truth you guys wont be able to win
Acedia,I wont play along with your sly interrogations Let me tell you just one thing Your existences themselves are a sin
Misuzu Kusakabe,You speak as if you are the one that yields justice
Acedia,All of you must disappear For the future
Misuzu Kusakabe,The future Kakeru go Leave this to me
Kakeru Satsuki,But Senpai your bodys still

Misuzu Kusakabe,Dont do it Kakeru You arent ready to use it yet If you fight this time your body will
Kakeru Satsuki,My bodys screaming out but I dont have a choice but to do it
Acedia,Whats wrong Are you done already
Yukiko Hirohara,Black Knight

Superbia,How the
Avaritia,Abraxus huh

Yukiko Hirohara,Its all right Senpai Yukasan isnt here There is no scent of blood
Misuzu Kusakabe,We cant say for sure that shes safe but it seems she at least escaped
Yukiko Hirohara,She couldnt have gone that far in this amount of time Lets split up and search for her
Misuzu Kusakabe,Its dangerous but I guess theres no choice Yukiko Kukuri Well search door to door around the school
Yukiko Hirohara,Understood
Misuzu Kusakabe,Kakeru and Takahisa are extremely exhausted While you wait until you recover fully search within the school
Kakeru Satsuki,No me too

Kakeru Satsuki,What
Takahisa Tajima,Nothing really I just wondered if I would become that stubborn if someone close to me disappeared Yukiko has the same scent as I do
Misuzu Kusakabe,Thats why it hurts to smile I guess youd call it karma
Yukiko Hirohara,Lets stop If you knew what Id done Im sure that even you would change
Takahisa Tajima,Ive been watching you all this time
Yukiko Hirohara,I know
Takahisa Tajima,Tell me about it
Yukiko Hirohara,Its a secret If youre too mindful of me itd just be awkward instead
Takahisa Tajima,How pathetic of me I worried too much These damn bugs Dont be eavesdropping on peoples secret conversations
Kakeru Satsuki,Takahisa
Takahisa Tajima,Lets go and search for your princess
Misuzu Kusakabe,The black moon is getting closer to the Earth

Yukiko Hirohara,Yukasan are you all right If we dont return quickly everyone will worry Ah thats right Ive got some good news Kukurisan took care of a Black Knight Kukurisans power was amazing
Yuka Minase,Everyone is amazing arent they
Yukiko Hirohara,Yes
Yuka Minase,Even though everyone has amazing powers and are risking their lives fighting Im the only one thats
Yukiko Hirohara,You dont have to worry about that Fighting doesnt fit you
Yuka Minase,Its because I didnt have any powers that Kakerukun left me
Yukiko Hirohara,What are you talking about Kakerusenpai and you are passionately in love arent you Hes only fighting because he wants to protect you Youre loved in a lot of different ways Why you little Yukasan Maybe Ill tell you about my past Up until a Japanese person picked me upN I lived in the country of Drasvenia By the time I was old enough to be aware of things the world was already hell itself A civil war to wash away blood with blood Everyone fought to hold what was precious to them amongst the mayhem and destruction Men women and children I have a immortal body If I blow myself up or step on a mine I still regenerate Thats why I was used as a human weapon My family and friends died one after another Thats why I killed and killed and continued to kill Only the phrase For my friends and tomorrow kept supporting me My personality and battle abilities were honed in that hell If they hadnt I wouldnt have been able to protect my friends and my future If I dont seal myself with my glasses I become a really dangerous girl I dont want you to be like me Yukasan Thats why its better not to awaken your powers to fight Im pretty sure Kakerusenpai would like it that way too
Yuka Minase,Yukikochan
Yukiko Hirohara,Yukasan
Yuka Minase,Yukikochan Im all right Im all right now After all I
Avaritia,Its useless This isnt something you can do
